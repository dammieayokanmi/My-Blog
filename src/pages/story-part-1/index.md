Going to the university wasn't the issue, but what course to study was. Straight from secondary school, my Biology teacher suggested I study Biochemistry because the person he knows who I happen to be more brilliant than studied biochemistry and she did fine. Being naive, I accepted and applied for biochemistry in Ladoke Akintola University of Technology. During the wait for an admission status, I went for a computer training(This was when I learnt to use the Corel Draw software). 

### Mathematics 
<!-- && Computer Science -->

My love for Mathematics was genuine, even classmates and teachers during my secondary school days could testify to this. I only had a rival in primary and my junoir years in secondary school who always lead me with few marks in graph - I couldn't identify which comes first between x and y axes.
Nevertheless, I will always choose calculations over theories.

<!-- Staying with computer science while we had to make a choice in 300L was so much ease and I was just waiting to become the real me with whatever thing I will be taught in the university hoping it will make the difference. I was happy with the life ahead despite silent fears and storms that hurried across my path. -->

### First Glance at Computer

Computers were like gold around 2005 generally in Nigeria based on my family status you did not get to see a computer not until my uncle who was staying with us got a desktop computer and the whole house celebrated - he was an electrical engineer who finished from the same university I would eventually go to study computer science. My family could not afford a desktop computer and you will visit friend who had computer to play games and stay over until the night was calling. -->

### University

My admission into the university came very late, I was offered Animal Nutrition and Biotechnology. I was not sad about the course because I never knew what I wanted in the first place- more like, anything goes for me. Besides I was admitted into the University which is like a golden opportunity for someone who scored 196 in <abbr title="Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board">JAMB</abbr>, got admitted for at the first attempt and for someone especially from my area [Wakajaye](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wakajaye+Road,+Ibadan/@7.4168802,3.9874232,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x103994aa90161bff:0x2fb919ce71ae2981!8m2!3d7.4168749!4d3.9896065).

Getting accomodation at school was hard, I stayed with my cousin who was in 200L in her very small room. My first few months were really rough,I had to go to school as early as 6am in order to get a sit for lectures (7am-2pm). Despite going by 6am, on my lucky days I sit at the back or on a broken chair else I stand during the whole lectures. By 6am, seats are already filled up with students, items [ pencil, stones, books, lipstick, jackets, name it (lol)] used by the 'early-early birds' to keep seats for their friends who are probably going to come very very late: making us (that came early but couldn't get a seat) look stupid- you know that feeling of standing while a pen is seating. Sometimes, I might get someone kind enough to share their seat with me or give up a seat they kept for their friend who didn't show up.


### HYPE and Failure
Few months later accomodation issue got solved, I got to stay with friends of a friend. Everything was almost fine until I collected my first semester 100L result(2.80/5.00)- if you know about it that is a very bad foundation to start with. I cried and was very sad but ther was nothing I could do about it, of course my dad was very dissapointed. I moved on, an oppurtunity to shange my course of study came, in my school you can cross over to whatever department you desire as long your <abbr title="Culmulative Grade Point Average">CGPA</abbr> meets the cut-off mark of that department. And as you may have guessed right only departments least desired accepts student with low <abbr title="Culmulative Grade Point Average">CGPA</abbr>. All hope seemed shattered, I was stranded in the department I was admitted to forever. Well, I grew and I realized the course is no go area for me; I have phobia for animals, but if you are in a department as mine you will breed animals as small as chicks, as dirty as pigs and as big as a cow. Now you see ahy I said I was stranded.
<br/> 
I am a christian and I believe in miracles as well as I believe unwavering faith in God does the impossible. I grew and I knew what course to study, I believe 'God plan towards me is of good and not of evil to give me an expected end'
### First Glace at Programming

After the training I didn't know what I could do with only <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> and learning a programming language was the next thing to be able to save data programmatically and I was very much excited with the possibilities of Java and C#. I struggled a lot with becoming better in Java and C# and I wasn't happy with my progress. Friends started building thing and we did come to lecture and discuss the thing we were learning, building and mastering as it was the culture in my university especially the computer science and engineering folks.

### New JavaScript Fan Boy

_Simple advice sometimes_ go a long way, a senior colleague said to me after years of encouraging me , learn JavaScript and know how to use some of it's main frameworks and use some software collaboration tools like git. I could have assumed in all my life that was the best piece of Advice I have ever received. It changed my life forever.

Immediately after university I started the serious learning of JavaScript and opportunities like working in, from a hub to stay the whole day and night was made available. The beginning of the fire started several night sessions when I would write a function and get undefined, I would be heart broken, but I never gave up.I worked with the likes of Usman Abiola and the boss -xniyi of cmapit. i learnt a lot. I was part of the team that organised 2 major events sponsor by cmapit in collaboration with github and jetbrains - I was very happy.

<!-- ### Pre-Nysc Days

Staying in back in the university after final exams helped me understand why I need to get better at programming. Staying inside UCH quarters came access to quality life and constant electric power supply. It was where I lived and learnt to code going for <abbr title="National Youth Service Corp">NYSC</abbr>. This were the days of little beginning.

Service year was coming and I wanted to work in a tech related environment so that I could advance my skills and be ready for post-nysc. I will say a few thing about my nysc days in the next episode. -->

_Thanks for Reading and keep coding_
