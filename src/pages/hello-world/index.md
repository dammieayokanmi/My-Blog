Everything in this community begins with `Hello, World` and I am excited to
start this blog. I will tell a small story of who I am, what I do.

The goal is to show up regularly here at least once in a week,  -maybe more.

I love CSS and I am beginning to fall in love with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).
I leave with this quote:
